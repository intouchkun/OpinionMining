This is code for project of Opinion mining by using Python with library tweepy , NLTK and calculate by using sentiwordnet

The project is about get the opinion about Iphone7 from Twitter and analyse the opinion twitter.

The code that we use is calculated for each word from tweets but it has the limitation because of twitter words that aren't fit with sentiwordnet database such as ' we are so happpy ' . the word ' happpy ' isn't in the database. etc. The other solution for analyse the opinion analysis is using machine learning such as SVM,Random Forest.

OutputOld.txt is file of tweets data before cleaning
OutputNew.txt is file of tweets data after cleaning
PositiveTweet.txt is file after analyse by using sentiwordnet that is positive tweets
NegativeTweet.txt is file after analyse by using sentiwordnet that is negative tweets
ObjectiveTweet.txt is file after analyse by using sentiwordnet that is objective tweets
